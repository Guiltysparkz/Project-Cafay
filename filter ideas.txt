for each ID fill an array named array1 (1 for first ID)
use if else to then select which arrays have corresponding product origin/scent etc effectively creating a filter

Better solution:
Use array_search to find if product array has [filter option] (espresso or filter per example)
Use array_shift to capture productID of each row
use the captured productID to check if it's within the productID I want to post
Integrate result[productArray number] in a html format
